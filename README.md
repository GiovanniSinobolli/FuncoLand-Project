# THE FUNCOLAND WEBISTE

Funcoland is a Simple WEB Application project using HTML5, CSS and JS to practice layout styling.

The main idea of the project was to create a website for the infamous american video game retailer that specialized in selling new and used video game software, with the aesthetics of a 2000's vibe, using a mix of modern and period-correct technology.
